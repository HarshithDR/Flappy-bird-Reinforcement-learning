# Flappy Bird with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements the classic Flappy Bird game in Python and uses **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)**, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train an AI agent to play the game autonomously. The agent learns to navigate the game environment by evolving through generations, optimizing its decision-making to survive longer and score higher. 

---

## Features
- **Game Development**: A fully functional Flappy Bird game built using Python.
- **Self-Playing Agent**: The AI agent learns to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **NeuroEvolution**: The NEAT algorithm evolves the bird's neural network by adjusting weights and topology, improving its performance with every generation.
- **Dynamic Learning**: The AI adapts to game dynamics, such as obstacle positioning and speed, by maximizing its fitness function.

## Key Technologies
1. **Python**: Core language for game development and AI implementation.
2. **Pygame**: Used for building the Flappy Bird game visuals and mechanics.
3. **NEAT-Python**: A Python library for implementing the NEAT reinforcement learning algorithm.

## How It Works
1. **Game Environment**:
   - Flappy Bird game mechanics such as bird motion, gravity, and pipes are recreated using Pygame.

2. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - The AI agent is controlled by a neural network trained using **NEAT**.
   - NEAT evolves the neural network through generations, improving the birdâ€™s decision-making based on fitness scores.

3. **Fitness Function**:
   - The fitness score is determined by the distance traveled by the bird, rewarding longer survival and penalizing collisions.

4. **Training Process**:
   - A population of neural networks is initialized, each controlling a separate bird.
   - Through simulation and competition, the top-performing networks evolve into the next generation.
